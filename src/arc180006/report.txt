We ran different implementations of merge sort for the array size of 16,000,000 32,000,000 64,000,000 128,000,000 
respectively
The running time output can be found in output.txt file

The average running time, as expected, generally decreases when running from choice 1(Take 2) to choice 4(Take 6) as we make 
more and more improvement to the merge sort algorithm from choice 1(Take 2) to choice 4(Take 6).
choice 2(Take 3) and choice 3(Take 4) have the least difference in running time and always faster than choice 1(Take 2).
choice 4(Take 6) implements iterative - bottom up approach and is generally faster than the first 3 implementations
